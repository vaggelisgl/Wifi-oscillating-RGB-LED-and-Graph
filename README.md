A python program creates 3 sine Waves in time which it then transmits through wifi to a seperate arduino UNO R4. The arduino oscilates all 3 colours of an RGB LED, 
with a phase difference of 2Ï€/3,to create a cool lighting effect.
This program was done in order to learn GUI in python and how to transmit data over wifi from pc to arduino (at least the uno R4, which has integrated wifi)
